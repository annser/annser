APL code for the ANNSER project.

To use the code:
1. adjust the path in Build.dyalog if necessary
1. start APL and load a clear workspace if necessary
1. load the Build function by invoking `]SALT.load '<path to repository>/src/apl/dev/Build.dyalog'`
1. run Build

You can run a simple demo by typing

    ]demo <path to repository>/src/apl/demo/demo.txt
    
and pressing ```enter``` to execute each line of code and see the result, if any.

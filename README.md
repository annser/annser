# ANNSER

This is the home of the ANNSER project.

ANNSER is A Neural Network Simulator for Education and Research.

ANNSER will

* Provide performant implementations of a range of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
* Implement a Domain-specific language for constructing, training and testing ANNs
* Provide a visual interface to the DSL
* Provide tutorials and documentation that support its use by students and researchers

If you are interested in experimenting with the code or contributing to development you will find some information
 [here](DEVELOPERS.md).
 
There is a discussion/support group [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/annser).

You will need to apply to join the group as that helps us to exclude spammers.

There's some background to the choice of APL [here](http://blog.rareschool.com/2016/05/big-data-on-small-computer.html)
and [here](http://blog.rareschool.com/2016/05/big-data-on-small-computer.html).

There are a series of blog posts explaining the code in the examples:

* [A brief introduction to ANNs - part 1](http://blog.rareschool.com/2016/05/neural-networks-on-raspbery-pi-neuron.html)
* [A brief introduction to ANNs - part 2](http://blog.rareschool.com/2016/05/neural-networks-on-raspberry-pi-more.html)
* [A brief introduction to ANNs - part 3](http://blog.rareschool.com/2016/05/neural-networks-on-raspberry-pi-sigmoid.html)

__NB:__ The code is __pre-Alpha__; implementations and APIs will change rapidily.

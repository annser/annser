# ANNSER

This is the home of the ANNSER project.

ANNSER is A Neural Network Simulator for Education and Research.

ANNSER will

* Provide performant implementations of a range of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
* Implement a Domain-specific language for constructing, training and testing ANNs
* Provide a visual interface to the DSL
* Provide tutorials and documentation that support its use by students and researchers

If you are interested in experimenting with the code or contributing to development you will find some information
 [here](DEVELOPRS.md).
 
There is a discussion/support group [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/annser).

You will need to apply to join the group as that helps us to exclude spammers.

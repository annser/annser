This is the home of the ANNSER project.

ANNSER is A Neural Network Simulator for Education and Research.

ANNSER will

* Provide performant implementations of a range of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
* Implement a Domain-specific language for constructing, training and testing ANNs
* Provide a visual interface to the DSL
* Provide tutorials and documentation that support its use by students and researchers

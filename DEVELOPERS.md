# Code contents

At present ANNSER has a few APL functions and some test data.

Some Python code will soon be added, but it will only be used for comparison and testing purposes.

The APL code snd the APL workspace were created using Dyalog APL for Raspberry Pi using a beta version 15.0

The code does not use 15.0 features and should run on Dyalog 14.1.

If you want to experiment with the code on the Raspberry Pi you will need to install the current version of Dyalog APL.

An introduction to Dyalog on the Pi is available [here](http://www.dyalog.com/dyalog/raspberry-pi.htm);
that page contains a link to download instructions.

An introductory eBook for APL on the Pi is under development and an early access version should be available on Leanpub
within the next few days.
